 * amdeth.c: #include <unistd.h> to silence compiler warning
   (rtems-4.10 / sleep()).
 20091209 (T.S)
 * amdeth.h: added public declaration of amdEthDumpStats()
 20091017 (T.S)
 * amdeth.c: removed CPP redefines.

 * amdeth.h, amdeth.c:
   o Added support for the 79970 device (emulated by qemu) and
     handling of qemu 'quirks' (bugs).
   o Added support for IP and UDP 'header types' (basically to
     let the driver know how long the buffer attached to the
     first descriptor slot is.
   o Added work-around for zero-length header. The single
     buffer is 'distributed' into two descriptors; the first
     one pointing at the head, the second one at some offset...
   o Added 'cleanup' function pointer argument to amdEthCloseDev()
     (***BREAKING API***). This can be used to release buffer
     resources when the driver is shut down.
   o Added support for multicast filter.
